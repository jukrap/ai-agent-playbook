# Skill Taxonomy v2

Skill taxonomy v2는 capability category를 1차 축으로 씁니다. 스택별 세부사항은 reference나 profile로 내립니다.

## Categories

- `foundation`: repo onboarding, bootstrap, project docs, requirements, planning, release notes, documentation package.
- `delivery`: planning, eval, verification, testing, git, PR, worklog flow.
- `architecture`: FSD, layered architecture, DDD, monorepo, boundary review.
- `frontend`: UI, state, data, accessibility, performance, visual QA.
- `backend`: API contract, connector, auth, server-rendered flow, worker, integration.
- `database`: schema change, migration, SQL, reporting, data integrity.
- `devops`: CI/CD, container, package release, deployment, configuration, observability.
- `security`: secret, threat modeling, authorization, dependency risk, compliance evidence.
- `mobile`: Expo, React Native, native app release, permission, offline sync, WebView bridge, device QA.
- `data`: analytics, pipeline, ETL, dashboard, source registry, data quality.
- `ai-harness`: MCP, skill, agent, context engineering, fact gate, witness history, cache, index design.
- `legacy`: legacy change safety와 compatibility strategy.

## Wrapper Policy

스택명 스킬은 유용한 trigger name이면 compatibility wrapper로 남길 수 있습니다. Wrapper는 primary capability skill을 가리키고, 스택 세부사항은 `references/`에 둡니다.

예를 들어 `legacy-java-spring-mvc`는 backend server-rendered change 작업으로 라우팅하고 Spring MVC 세부사항은 reference 파일에 둡니다.

## AI Harness Governance Pack

AI harness skill은 MCP surface design을 context engineering, skill-pack governance, runtime index/cache contract와 분리합니다.

- `ai-harness/mcp-server-design`: MCP tool, resource, prompt, permission tier, write gate, cache/index surface.
- `ai-harness/context-engineering-memory-design`: agent instruction, context surface, prompt/cache budget, project memory, compaction behavior, durable memory promotion, stale fact handling.
- `ai-harness/skill-pack-governance`: skill taxonomy growth, compatibility wrapper, reference routing, translation, install/sync behavior, reusable skill-pack adoption.
- `ai-harness/runtime-index-cache-design`: runtime report, index, graph, cache, artifact schema, invalidation, canon promotion, generated evidence, local-only runtime storage.
- `ai-harness/capability-witness-history`: append-only capability witness, baseline comparison, skipped/degraded status, runtime reliability history.
- `ai-harness/pre-action-fact-gate`: risky action 전 concrete fact, scan range, owner, importer, schema, rollback path, write-tier escalation.
- `meta/agent-skill-authoring`: reusable skill structure, trigger description, reference, skill/template boundary.

AI harness guidance는 always-on prompt와 core tool surface를 좁게 유지해야 합니다. Default context를 키우기 전에 selected skill, reference, recipe, CLI command, MCP resource, opt-in tool을 우선합니다.

## Backend And Security Pack

Backend와 security skill은 capability-first name을 씁니다.
